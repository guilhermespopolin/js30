            Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and he's stuck with his 
            heartless relatives, who force him to live in a tiny closet under the stairs. 
            But his fortune changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth 
            about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues him from his 
            relatives and takes him to his new home, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and 
            Wizardry.

            After a lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally feels like 
            a normal kid. But even within the Wizarding community, he is special. He is 
            the boy who lived: the only person to have ever survived a killing curse 
            inflicted by the evil Lord Voldemort, who launched a brutal takeover of the 
            Wizarding world, only to vanish after failing to kill Harry.

            Though Harry's first year at Hogwarts is the best of his life, not everything 
            is perfect. There is a dangerous secret object hidden within the castle walls,
            and Harry believes it's his responsibility to prevent it from falling into evil 
            hands. But doing so will bring him into contact with forces more terrifying 
            than he ever could have imagined.

            Ever since Harry Potter had come home for the summer, the Dursleys had been so mean 
            and hideous that all Harry wanted was to get back to the Hogwarts School for 
            Witchcraft and Wizardry. But just as he’s packing his bags, Harry receives a 
            warning from a strange impish creature who says that if Harry returns to Hogwarts, 
            disaster will strike.
          </p>
          <p>
            And strike it does. For in Harry’s second year at Hogwarts, fresh torments and 
            horrors arise, including an outrageously stuck-up new professor and a spirit who 
            haunts the girls’ bathroom. But then the real trouble begins – someone is turning 
            Hogwarts students to stone. Could it be Draco Malfoy, a more poisonous rival than 
            ever? Could it possible be Hagrid, whose mysterious past is finally told? Or could 
            it be the one everyone at Hogwarts most suspects… Harry Potter himself!

            Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts is full of new dangers. A convicted murderer, 
            Sirius Black, has broken out of Azkaban prison, and it seems he's after Harry. Now 
            Hogwarts is being patrolled by the dementors, the Azkaban guards who are hunting 
            Sirius. But Harry can't imagine that Sirius or, for that matter, the evil Lord 
            Voldemort could be more frightening than the dementors themselves, who have the 
            terrible power to fill anyone they come across with aching loneliness and despair. 
            Meanwhile, life continues as usual at Hogwarts. A top-of-the-line broom takes Harry's 
            success at Quidditch, the sport of the Wizarding world, to new heights. A cute fourth-year 
            student catches his eye. And he becomes close with the new Defense of the Dark Arts 
            teacher, who was a childhood friend of his father. Yet despite the relative safety of 
            life at Hogwarts and the best efforts of the dementors, the threat of Sirius Black 
            grows ever closer. But if Harry has learned anything from his education in wizardry, 
            it is that things are often not what they seem. Tragic revelations, heartwarming 
            surprises, and high-stakes magical adventures await the boy wizard in this funny and 
            poignant third installment of the beloved series.

            Harry Potter is midway through his training as a wizard and his coming of age. 
            Harry wants to get away from the pernicious Dursleys and go to the International 
            Quidditch Cup with Hermione, Ron, and the Weasleys. He wants to dream about Cho 
            Chang, his crush (and maybe do more than dream). He wants to find out about the 
            mysterious event that's supposed to take place at Hogwarts this year, an event 
            involving two other rival schools of magic, and a competition that hasn't happened 
            for hundreds of years. He wants to be a normal, fourteen-year-old wizard. But 
            unfortunately for Harry Potter, he's not normal - even by wizarding standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            And in his case, different can be deadly.

            There is a door at the end of a silent corridor. And it’s haunting Harry Pottter’s 
            dreams. Why else would he be waking in the middle of the night, screaming in terror?

          <p>
            Harry has a lot on his mind for this, his fifth year at Hogwarts: a Defense Against 
            the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a big surprise on the 
            Gryffindor Quidditch team; and the looming terror of the Ordinary Wizarding Level 
            exams. But all these things pale next to the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named - a 
            threat that neither the magical government nor the authorities at Hogwarts can stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the grasp of darkness tightens, Harry must discover the true depth and strength of 
            his friends, the importance of boundless loyalty, and the shocking price of unbearable 
            sacrifice.
          </p>

            His fate depends on them all.

          As Death Eaters wreak havoc in both Muggle and Wizard worlds, Hogwarts is no 
          longer a safe haven for students. Though Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) suspects 
          there are new dangers lurking within the castle walls, Dumbledore is more 
          intent than ever on preparing the young wizard for the final battle with 
          Voldemort. Meanwhile, teenage hormones run rampant through Hogwarts, 
          presenting a different sort of danger. Love may be in the air, but tragedy 
          looms, and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

            Harry Potter is leaving Privet Drive for the last time. But as he climbs 
            into the sidecar of Hagrid’s motorbike and they take to the skies, he 
            knows Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters will not be far behind.
